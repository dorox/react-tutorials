===============================
---------------------------
This is an interactive programming environment for data analysis, simulation, physical and chemical properties access.

#### When to use it:
1. You are working with large datasets.
2. There is a large number of repetetive operations for every bit of data analysis.
3. You want to produce well-formatted illustrations, but don't want to use Origin.
4. You would like to test hypothesis or learn how the process operates using modelling.
5. You are looking to derive numerical parameters from experimental data and Excel's linear fit is not enough.
6. You need to run linux-only reasearch software.
7. You want to learn GIT, Linux command line, Python.

#### When not to use it:
1. You are not ready to invest time to learn programming in Python.
2. You don't have a concrete work plan.
3. The datasets are small enough to be analysed in Excel.
4. There is a Windows software that does all your tasks.
