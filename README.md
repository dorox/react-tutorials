---------------------------
This is a collection of tutorials for a private (yet) chemical and chemical engineering simulation module.

#### Chemical mechanisms:
1. Examples of simple chemical reactions: [Chemistry_basics.ipynb](./Chemistry_basics.ipynb)
1. Finding the kinetic constants from experimental data: [Chemistry_fitting.ipynb](./Chemistry_fitting.ipynb)
1. Advanced examples of oscillatory reactions (chemical clock, predator-prey): [Chemistry_Oscillations.ipynb](./Chemistry_Oscillations.ipynb)
1. Michaelis-Menten kinetics: approximated model and exact numerical solution (incomplete): [Chemistry_Michaelis-Menten.ipynb](./Chemistry_Michaelis-Menten.ipynb)
1. Reproducing experiments for activation energy measurements (to be simplified): [Activation_energy.ipynb](./Activation_energy.ipynb)

#### Continuous reactors: CSTR and PFR:
1. Examples of setups for dynamic systems with single reactors: [Reactors_basics.ipynb](./Reactors_basics.ipynb)
1. Combinations of reactors in series: [Flowsheet.ipynb](./Flowsheet.ipynb)
1. Fitting experimental data from continuous reactors is currently not available.
